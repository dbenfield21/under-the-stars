## Getting Started
### **Description & Background**
Under the Stars is a camping app intended for users to be able to track their favorite campsites. It allows users to add campsites, rate other campsites, view what campsites other users have added, as well as allowing them to follow other users. 

I love camping and exploring in the mountains, its actually what my husband and I did for our honeymoon and we go every year on our anniversary.
