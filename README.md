## Getting Started
### **Description & Background**
Under the Stars is a camping app intended for users to be able to track their favorite campsites. It allows users to add campsites, rate other campsites, view what campsites other users have added, as well as allowing them to follow other users. 

I love camping and exploring in the mountains, its actually what my husband and I did for our honeymoon and we go every year on our anniversary. 


Some of the features I chose: 

- Each of the card images relates to a critical theme/character/ or reference to Harry Potter. 

- Obliviate is a spell in Harry Potter to remove memories, hence the game's name. 

- Alohomora, the games reset button, is a spell to unlock. When you click Alohomora it unlocks a new game.

**[Obliviate](https://unit1-memorygame-darby.surge.sh/) can be played here. It functions just like any other matching card game you may have played.**

## Next Steps

 Planned future enhancements that I would like to make:
  
 
- Peek at the board button to show card layout before the game begins
- Improved CSS styling
- Add additional messages
  -  When a match is made, "match made" 
  -  When two cards are not matches, "try again"
- Add animations to buttons and messages 
- Add sounds 
- Add additional cards
- Add a timer to track the time it takes to match all cards
